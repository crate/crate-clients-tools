# Machine Learning with CrateDB

This documentation section lists machine learning applications and frameworks
which can be used together with CrateDB.


## LangChain

```

[LangChain] is a framework for developing applications powered by language models,
written in Python, and with a strong focus on composability. As a language model
integration framework, LangChain's use-cases largely overlap with those of language
models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and
code analysis.

LangChain supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which is a technique for
augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data, and mixing
in "prompt engineering" as the process of structuring text that can be interpreted and
understood by a generative AI model. A prompt is natural language text describing the
task that an AI should perform.

The [LangChain adapter for CrateDB] provides support to use CrateDB as a vector store
database, to load documents using LangChain's DocumentLoader, and also supports
LangChain's conversational memory subsystem.

- CrateDB's `FLOAT_VECTOR` type and its `KNN_MATCH` function can be used for storing and
  retrieving embeddings, and for conducting similarity searches.

```

[MLflow] is an open source platform to manage the whole ML lifecycle, including
experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry.

The [MLflow adapter for CrateDB], available through the [mlflow-cratedb] package,
provides support to use CrateDB as a storage database for the [MLflow Tracking]
subsystem, which is about recording and querying experiments, across code, data,
config, and results.

```

[PyCaret] is an open-source, low-code machine learning library for Python that
automates machine learning workflows.

It is a high-level interface and AutoML wrapper on top of your loved machine learning
libraries like scikit-learn, xgboost, ray, lightgbm, and many more. PyCaret provides a
universal interface to utilize these libraries without needing to know the details
of the underlying model architectures and parameters.
