```
[Apache Airflow] is an open source software platform to programmatically author,
schedule, and monitor workflows, written in Python.
[Astronomer] offers managed Airflow services on the cloud of your choice, in
order to run Airflow with less overhead.

Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an
arbitrary number of workers. Pipelines are defined in Python, allowing for
dynamic pipeline generation and on-demand, code-driven pipeline invocation.

Pipeline parametrization is using the powerful Jinja templating engine.
To extend the system, you can define your own operators and extend libraries
to fit the level of abstraction that suits your environment.

```

[dbt] is an open source tool for transforming data in data warehouses using Python and
SQL. It is an SQL-first transformation workflow platform that lets teams quickly and
collaboratively deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices
like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation.

> dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same
> practices that software engineers use to build applications.

With dbt, anyone on your data team can safely contribute to production-grade data
pipelines.

The idea is that data engineers make source data available to an environment where
dbt projects run, for example with [Debezium](#debezium) or with [Airflow](#apache-airflow).
Afterwards, data analysts can run their dbt projects against this data to produce models
(tables and views) that can be used with a number of [BI tools](#bi-tools).

  with the powerful Discovery API.
- Extend your workflow beyond dbt Cloud with 30+ seamless integrations covering a range
  of use cases across the Modern Data Stack, from observability and data quality to
  visualization, reverse ETL, and much more.
- Ship more high-quality data and scale your development like the 1000s of companies that
  use dbt Cloud. They’ve used its convenient and collaboration-friendly interface to
  eliminate the bottlenecks that keep growth limited.

```

With [FlowFuse], and [FlowFuse Cloud], essentially unmanaged and managed DevOps
for Node-RED, you can reliably deliver Node-RED applications in a continuous,
collaborative, and secure manner.

- **Collaborative Development:** FlowFuse adds team collaboration to Node-RED,
  allowing multiple developers to work together on a single instance. With
  FlowFuse, developers can easily share projects, collaborate in real-time and
  streamline workflow for faster development and deployment.
- **Manage Remote Deployments:** Many organizations deploy Node-RED instances to
  remote servers or edge devices. FlowFuse automates this process by creating
  snapshots on Node-RED instances that can be deployed to multiple remote targets.
  It also allows for rollback in cases where something might not have gone correctly.
- **Streamline Application Delivery:** FlowFuse simplifies the software development
  lifecycle of Node-RED applications. You can now set up DevOps delivery pipelines
  to support development, test and production environments for Node-RED application
  delivery, see [Introduction to FlowFuse].
- **Flexible FlowFuse Deployment:** We want to make it easy for you to use FlowFuse,
  so we offer FlowFuse Cloud, a managed cloud service, or a self-hosted solution.
  You have the freedom to choose the deployment method that works best for your
  organization.
