# Monitoring and Metrics with CrateDB

Storing metrics data for the long term is a common need in systems monitoring
scenarios. CrateDB offers corresponding integration adapters.

```

[Prometheus] is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit
for collecting metrics data from applications and infrastructures.

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e.
metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded,
alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.

:::{rubric} Features
:::
Prometheus's main features are:

- a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs
- PromQL, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
- no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
- time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
- pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
- targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
- multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support


:::{rubric} Remote Endpoints and Storage
:::
The [Prometheus remote endpoints and storage] subsystem, based on its
[remote write] and [remote read] features, allows to transparently
send and receive metric samples. It is primarily intended for long term
storage.

This is where CrateDB comes into place. Using the [CrateDB Prometheus
Adapter], one can easily store the collected metrics data in CrateDB and
take advantage of its high ingestion and query speed and friendly UI to
massively scale-out Prometheus.

[Telegraf] is a leading open source server agent to help you collect metrics
from your stacks, sensors, and systems. More than 200 adapters to connect
to other systems leaves nothing to be desired.

Telegraf is a server-based agent for collecting and sending all metrics and
events from databases, systems, and IoT sensors. Telegraf is written in Go
and compiles into a single binary with no external dependencies, and requires
a very minimal memory footprint.

:::{rubric} Overview
:::

- **IoT sensors**: Collect critical stateful data (pressure levels, temperature
  levels, etc.) with popular protocols like MQTT, ModBus, OPC-UA, and Kafka.

- **DevOps Tools and frameworks**: Gather metrics from cloud platforms,
  containers, and orchestrators like GitHub, Kubernetes, CloudWatch, Prometheus,
  and more.

- **System telemetry**: Metrics from system telemetry like iptables, Netstat,
  NGINX, and HAProxy help provide a full stack view of your apps.
