# CrateDB Ecosystem Catalog

Database drivers, libraries, frameworks, and applications for CrateDB.


:::{rubric} About CrateDB
:::
CrateDB is a distributed and scalable open-source SQL database based on Lucene,
with PostgreSQL compatibility.
CrateDB clusters store information in the range of billions of records, and
terabytes of data, and run analytics in near real time, even with complex
queries.
CrateDB can be used for enterprise data warehouse workloads, it
works across clouds and scales with your data.

## Connectivity

The canonical set of database drivers, client- and developer-applications, and
how to configure them to connect to CrateDB.

Just to name a few, the sections below are about the CrateDB Admin UI, the
Crash CLI terminal program, connecting with PostgreSQL's psql client, the
DataGrip, and DBeaver IDE applications, the Java/JDBC/Python drivers, the
SQLAlchemy and Flink dialects, and more.
