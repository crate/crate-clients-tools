(dask)=
## Dask

[Dask] is a parallel computing library for analytics with task scheduling.
It is built on top of the Python programming language, making it easy to scale
the Python libraries that you know and love, like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

```

- [Dask DataFrames] help you process large tabular data by parallelizing pandas,
  either on your laptop for larger-than-memory computing, or on a distributed
  cluster of computers.

- [Dask Futures], implementing a real-time task framework, allow you to scale
  generic Python workflows across a Dask cluster with minimal code changes,
  by extending Python's `concurrent.futures` interface.

```

[pandas] is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy to use open source data analysis
and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. 

Pandas (stylized as pandas) is a software library written for the Python programming
language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures
and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

:::{rubric} Data Model
:::
- Pandas is built around data structures called Series and DataFrames. Data for these
  collections can be imported from various file formats such as comma-separated values,
  JSON, Parquet, SQL database tables or queries, and Microsoft Excel.
- A Series is a 1-dimensional data structure built on top of NumPy's array.
- Pandas includes support for time series, such as the ability to interpolate values
  and filter using a range of timestamps.
- By default, a Pandas index is a series of integers ascending from 0, similar to the
  indices of Python arrays. However, indices can use any NumPy data type, including
  floating point, timestamps, or strings.
- Pandas supports hierarchical indices with multiple values per data point. An index
  with this structure, called a "MultiIndex", allows a single DataFrame to represent
  multiple dimensions, similar to a pivot table in Microsoft Excel. Each level of a
  MultiIndex can be given a unique name.

```

[Polars] is a blazingly fast DataFrames library with language bindings for
Rust, Python, Node.js, R, and SQL. Polars is powered by a multithreaded,
vectorized query engine, it is open source, and written in Rust.

- **Fast:** Written from scratch in Rust and with performance in mind,
  designed close to the machine, and without external dependencies.

- **I/O:** First class support for all common data storage layers: local,
  cloud storage & databases.

- **Intuitive API:** Write your queries the way they were intended. Polars,
  internally, will determine the most efficient way to execute using its query
  optimizer. Polars' expressions are intuitive and empower you to write
  readable and performant code at the same time.

- **Out of Core:** The streaming API allows you to process your results without
  requiring all your data to be in memory at the same time.

- **Parallel:** Polars' multi-threaded query engine utilises the power of your
  machine by dividing the workload amongst the available CPU cores without any
  additional configuration.

- **Vectorized Query Engine:** Uses [Apache Arrow], a columnar data format, to
  process your queries in a vectorized manner and SIMD to optimize CPU usage.
  This enables cache-coherent algorithms and high performance on modern processors. 

- **Open Source:** Polars is and always will be open source. Driven by an active
  community of developers. Everyone is encouraged to add new features and contribute.
  It is free to use under the MIT license.

:::{rubric} Data formats
:::

Polars supports reading and writing to many common data formats.
This allows you to easily integrate Polars into your existing data stack.
 
- Text: CSV & JSON
- Binary: Parquet, Delta Lake, AVRO & Excel
- IPC: Feather, Arrow
- Databases: MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, Sqlite, Redshift & Oracle
- Cloud Storage: S3, Azure Blob & Azure File
