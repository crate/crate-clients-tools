# CrateDB and ORM libraries

This documentation section lists ORM libraries and frameworks which can
be used together with CrateDB. Hands-on tutorials about them can be found
on the ["connect" section of the CrateDB Guide].

```

[SQLAlchemy] is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that
gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

It plays an important role, because popular Python-based [DataFrame](df.md)
and [ML](../integrate/ml.md) libraries, and a few [ETL](../integrate/etl.md)
frameworks, are using SQLAlchemy as data abstraction library when connecting to
[RDBMS].
