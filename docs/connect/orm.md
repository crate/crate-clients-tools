```

[SQLAlchemy] is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that
gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

Python-based [DataFrame](df.md)
and [ML](../integrate/ml.md) libraries, and a few [ETL](../integrate/etl.md)
frameworks, are using SQLAlchemy as database adapter library when connecting to
[RDBMS].
